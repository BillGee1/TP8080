# TP8080
This is a project to generate 8080 and 8085 programs using Turbo Pascal for CP/M.

It is not to modify Turbo Pascal to generate 8080 code directly nor make it run on an 8080 system.

There are several components:

* A program to translate code generated by Turbo Pascal to 8080 assembly language
* The run-time library rewritten to use only 8080 instructions
* A way to combine the two

The current intent is to be able to do this on a CP/M system.  A Z80 may or may not be required for the build process; we shall see.
